# Compiling `.asm`
e.g. `binary_tree.asm`:


`nasm -g -f elf64 -o binary_tree.o binary_tree.asm && gcc -g -o binary_tree binary_tree.o -no-pie`

# P.S.
The project was split into sub-problems. It's yet to be completed.

☑ Representing and operating on binary trees (pointers)

☑ Representing and operating on binary trees (sequential representation, 1D arrays)

☑ Loading & exporting binary trees (in their sequential representation)

☑ Array operations (pop, insert, selection sort)

☐ Compressing text

☐ Decompressing text


I documented my process in public from getting the idea to approaching challenges on this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/5akhawy/status/1605246373418631168).
